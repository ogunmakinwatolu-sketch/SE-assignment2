# SE-Assignment2: Version Control Using GitHub
## 📖 Project Description
This project was developed as part of the CINS 5318 Software Engineering course to demonstrate the use of Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration.  
It walks through essential Git operations such as creating repositories, committing changes, branching, resolving conflicts, and collaborating through pull requests and code reviews.

The simple Python program `Hello.py` evolves over multiple branches to include new features, merge operations, and conflict resolution — showcasing the complete software version control lifecycle.
